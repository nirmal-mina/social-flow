Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, impact, and potential fixes.
Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.


Response Process:

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
Our security team will investigate and provide a resolution timeline within 7 days.
We will work with you to validate the fix before public disclosure.


Responsible Disclosure:

We request that you do not share details of the vulnerability publicly until we have released a fix.
We will credit you for the discovery (if desired) in our release notes.



Secure Development Practices

Code Reviews: All code undergoes mandatory security reviews.
Static Analysis: Use SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint, and Detekt for code scanning.
Dependency Scanning: Regular scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
Penetration Testing: Periodic tests using tools in tools/security/penetration-testing.
Secrets Management: Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, never in code.

Known Security Considerations

Video Uploads: Files are scanned for malware using AWS Lambda and ClamAV.
API Security: Rate limiting and JWT validation at the API gateway.
Data Privacy: User data is encrypted and anonymized where possible.
