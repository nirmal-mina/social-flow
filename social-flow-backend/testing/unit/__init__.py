"""
Unit Testing Package for Social Flow Backend

This package contains isolated unit tests for core services and utilities.
Each test file focuses on a single service or module, with mocks/stubs
for external dependencies (DB, cache, APIs).

We use:
- pytest for test execution
- hypothesis for property-based testing
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- unittest.mock for dependency mocking
