## 🎯 Deploy in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
cd social-flow-backend

# Generate secret key
python -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Edit .env file with your credentials
nano .env
```

**Required variables:**
- `SECRET_KEY` (generated above)
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` (for email)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (for payments)

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Step 3: Test

```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","username":"testuser","password":"Test123!@#"}'

# Check your email for verification link
# Then visit API docs
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Test Suite:** Model 'metadata' attribute conflict - tests need fixes
2. **Optional Services:** FCM/Twilio not configured (email still works)
3. **Stripe Test Mode:** Using test keys by default (expected)

None of these block deployment.
