# Operations & Runbook

Monitoring & Observability
- Logs: structured JSON logs via common monitoring logger; route to centralized system (CloudWatch/ELK).
- Metrics: services expose Prometheus metrics endpoints; scrape with Prometheus and dashboard with Grafana.
- Tracing: use distributed tracing (Jaeger) to correlate requests across services.

Alerting
- Define alerts for:
  - High error rate (5xx) across API services
  - Increased queue backlog for workers
  - DB connection failures or high latency
  - Storage (S3) errors and object upload failures

Incident Runbook (short)
1. Detect & Triage: check dashboards and logs; identify affected services.
2. Contain: scale down faulty components, divert traffic, revoke compromised keys.
3. Mitigate: roll back deploy or apply hotfix; run smoke tests.
4. Recover: restore services, validate data integrity.
5. Post-mortem: write incident report and update docs/playbooks.
