# Objective: Predict viral potential of videos using machine learning models.

# Input Cases:
# - Video metadata (title, description, tags)
# - Early engagement metrics (first hour views/likes)
# - Creator statistics and history
# - Temporal and seasonal factors

# Output Cases:
# - Viral probability score (0-1)
# - Expected peak performance metrics
# - Trending timeline predictions
# - Recommendation boost factors

# Key Features:
# - XGBoost for structured features
# - Deep learning for content analysis
# - Time series analysis for trend detection
# - Multi-armed bandit for exploration
