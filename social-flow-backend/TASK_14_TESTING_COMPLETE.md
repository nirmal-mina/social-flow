## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Test Independence
- Each test creates its own test data
- No shared state between tests
- Tests can run in any order

### 2. Comprehensive Mocking
- External services mocked (Stripe, AWS, Redis)
- Database operations isolated
- No real API calls during tests

### 3. AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Clear test structure
- Easy to read and maintain
- Consistent across all tests

### 4. Edge Case Coverage
- Happy path tests
- Error condition tests
- Boundary value tests
- Invalid input tests

### 5. Async Testing
- Proper use of `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
- Async fixtures for async operations
- AsyncClient for API testing
