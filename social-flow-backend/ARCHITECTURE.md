Comprehensive Technical Blueprint
Author: Kumar NirmalTeam: Backend TeamDate: September 11, 2025
Executive Summary
Social Flow's backend is a state-of-the-art microservices architecture designed to deliver a scalable, secure, and high-performance video-sharing and social media platform. It integrates advanced video processing, real-time streaming, AI-driven personalization, and robust monetization features. The system is built for global scale, leveraging AWS services, multi-cloud storage, and a modular design to ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and compliance with international regulations.
Key Features

Video Processing: Multi-resolution transcoding, adaptive streaming, and AI-enhanced video quality.
Social Interactions: Threads, reposts, hashtags, and follows for a Twitter-like experience.
Live Streaming: Low-latency streaming with RTMP, WebRTC, and SRT support.
Recommendations: Personalized content recommendations using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning.
Content Moderation: AI-driven detection of NSFW, violence, and spam content.
Monetization: Supports ads, subscriptions, donations, and creator payouts.
Analytics: Real-time and batch processing for engagement and monetization metrics.
Search: Advanced search with Elasticsearch, including autocomplete and hashtag discovery.
Security: JWT-based authentication, encryption with AWS KMS, and compliance with GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and DMCA.
Scalability: Auto-scaling microservices, load balancing, and multi-region deployment.

Architecture Overview
The backend is organized into loosely coupled microservices, each deployed independently using Docker and orchestrated with AWS ECS or Kubernetes. Communication between services is handled via REST, gRPC, and event streaming (Kafka/Pulsar). The API gateway (Kong) manages routing, rate limiting, and authentication.
Microservices

User Service (services/user-service):

Manages user authentication, profiles, subscriptions, and social interactions.
Uses Go for high performance and AWS Cognito for authentication.
Stores data in CockroachDB with Redis caching.
Exposes REST and gRPC APIs.


Video Service (services/video-service):

Handles video uploads, transcoding, streaming, and live streaming.
Built with Node.js, using AWS MediaConvert for transcoding and AWS IVS for live streaming.
Stores videos in S3 and metadata in MongoDB.
Supports chunked uploads and adaptive bitrate streaming.


Recommendation Service (services/recommendation-service):

Provides personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning.
Built with Python and TensorFlow, deployed on AWS SageMaker.
Integrates with Elasticsearch for content metadata and Redis for user sessions.


Analytics Service (services/analytics-service):

Processes real-time and batch analytics for views, likes, shares, and monetization metrics.
Uses Scala and Apache Flink with AWS Kinesis for streaming data.
Stores results in InfluxDB and exposes dashboards via Grafana.


Search Service (services/search-service):

Powers search and hashtag discovery with Elasticsearch.
Built with Python and FastAPI, supporting personalized ranking and faceted search.
Integrates with recommendation service for trending hashtags.


Monetization Service (services/monetization-service):

Manages subscriptions, donations, ads, and creator payouts.
Built with Kotlin and integrated with Stripe and AWS Payment Cryptography.
Stores payment data securely with encryption.


Ads Service (services/ads-service):

Manages ad delivery and targeting using AWS Personalize and Pinpoint.
Built with Python and FastAPI.
Integrates with video service for ad insertion.


Payment Service (services/payment-service):

Handles payment processing for premium content and subscriptions.
Built with Python and integrated with Stripe.
Uses AWS KMS for secure payment data handling.


View Count Service (services/view-count-service):

Tracks video view counts in real-time using Redis.
Built with Python and FastAPI.
Publishes events to Kafka for analytics.



Shared Components

Common Libraries (common/libraries): Reusable libraries for authentication, database access, messaging, and monitoring in Go, Node.js, Python, and Kotlin.
Protobuf Schemas (common/protobufs): Standardized schemas for events, users, videos, and analytics.
AI Models (ai-models): Pre-trained models for content moderation, recommendation, and content analysis.
Workers (workers): Background tasks for video processing, AI inference, and analytics.

Infrastructure

Storage:
Object Storage: AWS S3 for videos, thumbnails, and analytics data.
Databases: CockroachDB (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL), Redis (caching), Elasticsearch (search), InfluxDB (time-series).


Event Streaming: Kafka and Pulsar for real-time event processing.
CDN: AWS CloudFront and Cloudflare for low-latency video delivery.
Compute: AWS ECS for container orchestration, Lambda for serverless tasks, and SageMaker for ML inference.
Networking: VPC, load balancers, and WAF for security.

Security

Authentication: JWT with AWS Cognito, supporting OAuth2 and MFA.
Authorization: RBAC and ABAC for fine-grained access control.
Encryption: AWS KMS for data at rest and in transit, TLS for network security.
Compliance: Adheres to GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and DMCA with audit logs and policies.

Scalability

Auto-scaling: ECS and Kubernetes for dynamic scaling based on load.
Load Balancing: AWS ALB and NLB for distributing traffic.
Sharding: Database sharding for CockroachDB and MongoDB.
Caching: Redis for session and metadata caching, CloudFront for video caching.

Monitoring

Metrics: Prometheus for collecting metrics, Grafana for dashboards.
Logging: Centralized logging with AWS CloudWatch and structured logging.
Tracing: Distributed tracing with Jaeger for performance analysis.
Alerting: Configurable alerts with PagerDuty integration.

Deployment Strategy
The system supports blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates, managed via ArgoCD and GitLab CI. Infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform, and deployments are automated with CI/CD pipelines. See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for details.
Future Enhancements

Edge Computing: Deploy recommendation and personalization services to edge locations using AWS Lambda@Edge.
Multi-Cloud: Extend storage and compute to Google Cloud and Azure for redundancy.
Advanced AI: Integrate generative AI for automated thumbnails, captions, and summaries.
