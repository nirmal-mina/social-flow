Social Flow Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers of Social Flow, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language.
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
Focusing on what is best for the community.
Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
Public or private harassment.
Publishing others' private information without permission.
Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, and communication channels (e.g., Slack, email). It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces, such as conferences or meetups.
Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at backend@socialflow.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of enforcement policies are available in SECURITY.md.
