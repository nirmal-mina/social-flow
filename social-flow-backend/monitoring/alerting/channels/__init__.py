Monitoring Alerting Channels Package

This package provides multiple implementations of alerting channels such as Slack,
Email, SMS, Webhook, Teams, and PagerDuty. Each channel inherits from the
BaseChannel class, ensuring consistency in configuration and sending alerts.

Usage Example:
--------------
from monitoring.alerting.channels import SlackChannel, EmailChannel

slack = SlackChannel(webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/...")
slack.send_alert("ðŸš¨ Critical CPU Usage Detected!")

email = EmailChannel(
    smtp_host="smtp.gmail.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    username="alerts@example.com",
    password="super-secret",
    from_addr="alerts@example.com",
    to_addrs=["admin@example.com"]
)
email.send_alert("ðŸš¨ Database latency exceeds threshold!")
