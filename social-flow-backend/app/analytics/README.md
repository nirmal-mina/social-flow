# analytics

## Purpose

Implements analytics data collection, aggregation, and query endpoints supporting engagement, performance, and business intelligence metrics.

## Responsibilities

- Ingest and persist analytics events
- Provide aggregation services & reporting APIs
- Trigger asynchronous processing / rollups

## Key Elements

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| analytics_processing.py | Batch / async processing tasks |
| api/ | (If present) routing for analytics endpoints |
| routes/ | HTTP route declarations |
| services/ | Business logic for metrics and rollups |
| tasks/ | Scheduled or queued workloads |
| models/ | ORM models for events & aggregates |

## Extension Points

- Add new aggregator service class implementing a common interface
- Introduce event normalization middleware

## Observability

- Emit counters for events processed / dropped
- Add histogram for query response times

## Security Considerations

- Enforce least privilege on analytics data (PII minimization)
- Anonymize or hash sensitive identifiers where possible

## TODO / Roadmap

- [ ] Implement dimensional model adapter
- [ ] Add time-windowed caching layer
- [ ] Provide export endpoints (CSV/Parquet)
