# ai_ml_services

## Purpose

Aggregates high-level AI/ML capability clusters (moderation, recommendation, sentiment, trending prediction, video analysis) behind cohesive service boundaries.

## Responsibilities

- Provide organized entrypoints per ML capability domain
- Coordinate shared pre/post-processing patterns
- Serve as fa√ßade for downstream API/service layers

## Key Subdirectories

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| content_moderation/ | Unsafe/toxic content detection pipelines |
| recommendation/ | Multi-algorithm recommendation strategies |
| sentiment_analysis/ | NLP sentiment & emotion inference |
| trending_prediction/ | Trend forecasting models |
| video_analysis/ | Video scene/object/action analysis |

## Extension Points

- Add new capability folder with a standardized interface (e.g. `run(payload)`)
- Register algorithms via lightweight plugin registry pattern

## Observability

- Add metrics: model latency, cache hit ratio, error classification
- Logging: include model version, inference duration

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize user-generated text before ML processing
- Rate limit expensive model inferences

## TODO / Roadmap

- [ ] Introduce model registry metadata loader
- [ ] Provide batch inference scheduler integration
- [ ] Add fallback strategies for degraded models
