## Test Failures Fixed

### 1. Security Layer Type Validation (4 tests fixed)

**Issue:** `verify_token()` crashed when receiving non-string token types  
**Tests Affected:**
- `test_decode_invalid_token_types[]`
- `test_decode_invalid_token_types[None]`
- `test_decode_invalid_token_types[123]`
- `test_verify_token_invalid`

**Root Cause:**
```python
# BEFORE: No type checking
def verify_token(token: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        # Crashed if token was None, int, etc.
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# AFTER: Type validation added
def verify_token(token: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    if not isinstance(token, str):
        return None  # Gracefully handle invalid types
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
```

**File:** `app/core/security.py` (lines 91-99)  
**Impact:** Prevents crashes from malformed API requests, improved security posture

---

### 2. Configuration Test Flexibility (2 tests fixed)

**Issue:** Config tests failed when database URL wasn't PostgreSQL  
**Tests Affected:**
- `test_database_url_is_valid_for_sqlalchemy`
- `test_local_development_defaults`

**Root Cause:**
Tests assumed production PostgreSQL database but development used SQLite:
```python
# BEFORE: Only accepted PostgreSQL
assert db_url.startswith("postgresql://")
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# AFTER: Accept both PostgreSQL and SQLite
valid_prefixes = ["postgresql://", "postgresql+asyncpg://", "sqlite:///"]
assert any(db_url.startswith(prefix) for prefix in valid_prefixes)
```

**File:** `tests/unit/test_config.py` (lines 164-177, 215-230)  
**Impact:** Tests now work in local development AND production environments

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Deploy Current Version** ✅
   - 100% test pass rate gives confidence
   - Core features well-tested
   - Set up monitoring for low-coverage areas

2. **Add Critical Path Tests** 🎯
   - Focus on recommendation service (biggest gap)
   - Add search service tests
   - Test most-used API endpoints

3. **Set Up Integration Tests** 🔧
   - Database operations
   - External API mocking (Stripe, AWS)
   - End-to-end user flows

### Medium-Term Goals (Next Month)

**Target: 60-70% Coverage**

Priority areas for improvement:
1. **Recommendation Service** (10% → 70%): +369 lines coverage
2. **Search Service** (17% → 70%): +149 lines coverage
3. **ML Service** (38% → 70%): +184 lines coverage
4. **Analytics Service** (24% → 70%): +138 lines coverage
5. **API Endpoints** (25% → 70%): ~500 lines coverage

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks with 1 developer

### Long-Term Vision (90%+ Coverage)

Achieving 90%+ coverage requires:
- **Additional 9,000 lines** of test coverage
- **Complex mocking infrastructure** for external services
- **Integration test frameworks** for WebSockets, background jobs
- **Dedicated testing resources** (1-2 weeks focused effort)

**Recommendation:** Not necessary unless required by compliance/policy. Current 39% coverage with 100% pass rate is production-ready for most organizations.
