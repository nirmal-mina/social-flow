# Social Flow Backend
Social Flow Backend
Overview
Social Flow is a robust, scalable, and secure backend architecture designed to power a next-generation video-sharing and social media platform. It combines the best features of video streaming platforms like YouTube with social interaction capabilities similar to Twitter. The platform supports advanced video processing, live streaming, AI-driven recommendations, content moderation, monetization, and comprehensive analytics, all deployed on a multi-cloud infrastructure with a focus on performance, security, and scalability.
This repository contains the complete backend architecture, including microservices, AI models, event streaming, storage configurations, and deployment pipelines. The system is designed to handle millions of users, process terabytes of video data, and provide real-time personalization and analytics.
Features

Video Processing: Supports video uploads, transcoding to multiple formats (H.264, H.265, AV1, VP9), adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH), and thumbnail generation using AWS MediaConvert and FFmpeg.
Social Interactions: Twitter-like threads, reposts, hashtags, and user follows, powered by a high-performance Go-based user service.
Live Streaming: Real-time streaming with RTMP, WebRTC, and SRT protocols, integrated with AWS IVS for low-latency delivery.
AI-Powered Recommendations: Machine learning models for collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, viral prediction, and trending analysis, deployed using AWS SageMaker.
Content Moderation: AI-driven NSFW, violence, and spam detection to ensure platform safety, using ResNet-50 and EfficientNet models.
Monetization: Supports subscriptions, donations, ads, and creator payouts, integrated with Stripe and AWS Payment Cryptography.
Analytics: Real-time and batch analytics for views, engagement, and monetization metrics, powered by Apache Flink and Scala.
Search: Advanced search and autocomplete powered by Elasticsearch, with personalized ranking and hashtag support.
Scalability: Microservices architecture with auto-scaling, load balancing, and multi-region deployment using AWS ECS, Lambda, and CloudFront.
Security: JWT-based authentication with AWS Cognito, encryption with AWS KMS, and compliance with GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and DMCA.
CI/CD: Automated pipelines using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD for continuous integration and deployment.
Monitoring: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and distributed tracing using Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch.

Architecture
The backend is organized into microservices, each responsible for specific functionality. The architecture is detailed in ARCHITECTURE.md. Key components include:

User Service: Manages user authentication, profiles, subscriptions, and social interactions (Go).
Video Service: Handles video uploads, transcoding, streaming, and live streaming (Node.js).
Recommendation Service: Provides personalized recommendations using ML models (Python).
Analytics Service: Processes real-time and batch analytics (Scala/Flink).
Search Service: Powers search and hashtag discovery (Python/Elasticsearch).
Monetization Service: Manages payments and ads (Kotlin).
API Gateway: Routes requests and enforces security policies (Kong/Envoy).
Workers: Background tasks for video processing, AI inference, and analytics (Node.js, Python).
Event Streaming: Kafka and Pulsar for real-time event processing.
Storage: AWS S3 for video storage, CockroachDB/MongoDB for data, and Redis/Elasticsearch for caching and search.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Docker: For containerized services.
AWS CLI: Configured with credentials for AWS services.
Node.js: Version 18+ for video service.
Go: Version 1.21+ for user service.
Python: Version 3.11+ for recommendation and search services.
Java: Version 17+ for analytics and monetization services.
Kotlin: For monetization service.
Terraform: For infrastructure provisioning.
kubectl: For Kubernetes-based deployments.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/social-flow/social-flow-backend.git
cd social-flow-backend


Set up environment variables:

Copy config/environments/development/config.yaml.example to config/environments/development/config.yaml.
Update with your AWS credentials, database URLs, and other configurations.


Build and run services using Docker Compose:
./scripts/setup/setup.sh


Initialize databases and run migrations:
./scripts/setup/db_migrate.sh


Access the API via the gateway at http://localhost:8000.


Deployment
Refer to DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions on deploying to AWS with Terraform, ECS, and Kubernetes.
