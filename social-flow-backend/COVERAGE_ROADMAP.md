## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid Approach

```
                 /\
                /  \
               /    \
              / E2E  \     ← 10% (User flows)
             /--------\
            /          \
           / Integration\  ← 30% (Service interactions)
          /-------------\
         /               \
        /   Unit Tests    \ ← 60% (Core logic)
       /-------------------\
```

### Current Distribution
- **Unit Tests:** 500 tests (100% of tests) ← Strong foundation ✅
- **Integration Tests:** 0 tests ← Need to add 🎯
- **E2E Tests:** 0 tests ← Future phase 📋

### Target Distribution (60-70% coverage)
- **Unit Tests:** 750 tests (80% of tests)
- **Integration Tests:** 150 tests (15% of tests)
- **E2E Tests:** 50 tests (5% of tests)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Writing Standards

#### 1. **Follow AAA Pattern**
```python
def test_example():
    # Arrange - Set up test data and mocks
    user_id = uuid4()
    mock_service = MagicMock()
    
    # Act - Execute the function being tested
    result = service.do_something(user_id)
    
    # Assert - Verify the outcome
    assert result is not None
    assert result["status"] == "success"
```

#### 2. **Use Descriptive Test Names**
```python
# Good ✅
def test_get_video_recommendations_returns_empty_list_when_no_videos_available()

# Bad ❌
def test_recommendations()
```

#### 3. **Test One Thing Per Test**
```python
# Good ✅
def test_recommendation_service_caches_results():
    # Only test caching behavior

def test_recommendation_service_filters_excluded_ids():
    # Only test filtering behavior

# Bad ❌
def test_recommendation_service():
    # Tests caching, filtering, sorting, AND edge cases
```

#### 4. **Mock External Dependencies**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_redis():
    """Mock Redis to avoid external dependency."""
    redis = AsyncMock()
    redis.get = AsyncMock(return_value=None)
    redis.setex = AsyncMock()
    return redis

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_with_mocked_redis(mock_redis):
    service = MyService(redis=mock_redis)
    # Test logic without actual Redis connection
```

#### 5. **Use Fixtures for Common Setup**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_videos():
    """Reusable test data."""
    return [
        Video(id=uuid4(), title="Video 1", view_count=100),
        Video(id=uuid4(), title="Video 2", view_count=200),
    ]

def test_sorting(sample_videos):
    # Use fixture in multiple tests
```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: External Dependencies
**Issue:** Hard to test AWS, Stripe, Redis without real services  
**Mitigation:**
- Use mocking libraries (unittest.mock, pytest-mock)
- Create test doubles for external services
- Use docker-compose for local test dependencies

### Risk 2: Async Code Complexity
**Issue:** Async/await makes testing harder  
**Mitigation:**
- Use pytest-asyncio plugin (already installed)
- Create AsyncMock fixtures
- Test async code with proper event loops

### Risk 3: Database State
**Issue:** Tests interfere with each other  
**Mitigation:**
- Use transactions that rollback after each test
- Create isolated test database
- Use pytest fixtures for cleanup

### Risk 4: Test Maintenance
**Issue:** More tests = more maintenance burden  
**Mitigation:**
- Write clear, simple tests
- Use shared fixtures to reduce duplication
- Document test purpose in docstrings
- Delete obsolete tests regularly

### Risk 5: Slow Test Suite
**Issue:** 500 tests take 4.5 minutes already  
**Mitigation:**
- Run fast tests in CI, slow tests nightly
- Use pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.slow`)
- Parallelize test execution with pytest-xdist
- Profile and optimize slowest tests

- **Cons:** Leaves other areas untested
- **Best for:** Critical paths, security features

### Option B: Breadth-First
Touch every module, bring all to 40-50% coverage
- **Pros:** Even coverage distribution, no blind spots
- **Cons:** Shallow testing, may miss edge cases
- **Best for:** Initial coverage boost, finding low-hanging fruit

### Option C: Risk-Based (Current Plan)
Prioritize by business impact and current coverage gap
- **Pros:** Maximize ROI, focus on what matters
- **Cons:** Requires good prioritization decisions
- **Best for:** Production systems, time-constrained projects ✅
