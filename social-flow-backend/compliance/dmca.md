# DMCA â€” Takedown & Counter-Notice Process (Draft)

Purpose
- Clear procedure for processing copyright takedown notices and counter-notices.

Takedown flow
1. Receive notice via designated channel (email/legal inbox). Log notice into ticketing system.
2. Validate notice contains required elements (identify copyrighted work, infringing URL, contact details, signature).
3. Quarantine or disable access to the allegedly infringing content immediately; preserve evidence.
4. Notify the uploader/creator of the action and provide counter-notice instructions.
5. Escalate to Legal if the uploader files a counternotice or if complex disputes arise.

Counter-notice
- Require valid counter-notice that includes statement under penalty of perjury and consent to jurisdiction.
- If a valid counter-notice is received, restore content after applicable waiting period unless complainant files a lawsuit.

Developer responsibilities
- Implement endpoints/admin UI to disable content and log actions.
- Preserve original content artifacts (hashes, timestamps) for potential legal review.
- Maintain retention of takedown logs per data_retention_policy.md.

Notes
- This document is procedural; Legal must approve and publish the official DMCA policy and contact points.
