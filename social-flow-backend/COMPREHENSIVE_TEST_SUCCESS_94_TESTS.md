## 🎓 Lessons from 94 Tests

### 1. **Model Field Names Are Critical**
Always verify exact field names before writing tests. Small differences like `user_id` vs `owner_id` cause systematic failures.

### 2. **Enum Values Must Match Exactly**
String enums in models must match validation expectations. Document enum values clearly.

### 3. **CRUD Patterns Should Be Consistent**
When a pattern works (like `create_with_user`), apply it consistently across similar models.

### 4. **Test Fixtures Save Time**
Reusable fixtures for users, posts, videos dramatically speed up test creation.

### 5. **Systematic Fixes Are Efficient**
When multiple tests fail with the same error, fix the root cause once instead of patching individual tests.

### 6. **Document As You Go**
Progress reports and success documents help track what's done and what's next.

### 7. **Edge Cases Matter**
Testing 404s, validation errors, and auth failures catches production bugs early.

### 8. **Integration Tests Are Valuable**
Testing cross-module interactions (follow → feed, like → analytics) validates real workflows.
